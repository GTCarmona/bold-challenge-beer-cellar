### Bold challenge - Beer Cellar

Full MERN stack developed between 4~5 hours

Setup: boilerplate used during my time in IronHack bootcamp as a student, same used in my last project. I chosed to do this because of the timeframe, as this gives me the basic setup for MongoDB and the authentication process with Passport.

Link to deployed version: https://challenge-my-beer-cellar.herokuapp.com/

Technologies used in this challenge:
-JavaScript / -React (Hooks) / Node.js / MongoDB / Express.js / HTML / SCSS / React Bootstrap

Features able to implement within the time period

- View of list of all beers
- Detailed view of specified beer
- View with form to add a new bottle
- Sorting by beer name, and filtering by beer type OR style (not 100%)
- User signup and login, so initialy only the user would see the beers that were added by him, an they are stored in the database.

I wanted to implement some elements with a database because I thought it made sense given the context and I wanted to practice this implementation together with React Hooks

With more time I would:

- I did not prioritize the style at all, so I would work on it.
- Add comments and ratings
- Image upload for beers and user
- Make it possible for other users to comment and rate your beers, and vice-versa
